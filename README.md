# Cat Memory Game

## Description
> Click on a card to win a point. Unlock levels with more points. Game gets over if same card is clicked twice.

## Challenges I faced
1. I downloaded the images beforehand, so had to set up a way to import them efficiently and create the cats data array.
2. One single click leads to multiple changes, so everything had to be done inside one click handler without making the code messy. 
3. Correctly setting the states and in the right order.
